Plan:

1. Generate synthetic:

- prior
- test dataset/decision points
- cost 

2. Settings

- Plain setting
* Compare with EI and random (slightly better than EI/time)

- Cost-aware
* Compare with EI/time (almost the same as EI/time)
* Compare with plain setting

- Multi-user cost aware
* Compare with k-Round Robin 
* Compare with Random
* Compare with k-Round Robin + 'most variance drop'
